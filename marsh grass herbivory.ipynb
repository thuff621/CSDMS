    "This notebook demonstrates coupling of an ABM implemented in Mesa and a grid-based numerical model written in Landlab. The example is adpated from the canonical \"wolf-sheep-grass\" example of an agent-based model. Here we remove the wolves, convert the sheep to a general herbivore, and add in salt marsh ecogeomorphic evolution: when herbivore eats the marsh grass, the sediments becomes more erodible, and the roughness is reduced. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rules in this example are deliberately simple. The main goal of this tutorial is to illustrate the mechanics of building an integrated model that combines agent-based elements (via Mesa) with continuum-based elements (via Landlab) on a shared grid.\n",
