# pymarshmorpho2d
Python implementation of Giulio Mariotti's MarshMorpho2D has been modified to add in the CWEM to drive vegetation dynamics.

Model inputs:
    Digital elevation model: the basis for the model grid. The DEM resolution dictates the model's spatial resolution
    Initial water level
    Sea Level rise
    User defined soil properties
